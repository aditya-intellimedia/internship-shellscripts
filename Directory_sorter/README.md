# What is Directory_sorter?

Directory sorter is the linux bash script programe which sort all files in certain directory as per the extension of the files.
Suppose any directory contains ten different types of files with various extension, then on executing this programme different directory named 
all.extension will be created and all files containing same extension will be moved to coresponding directory.And directory will be sorted.

Run this code with standard syntax of linux code file:

./finalcode.sh

Enter the name of the directory you want to sort : "       "
If any directory doesn't excist in the machine than it will show "This directory doesn't excist"
